Python bindings for EACopy, a high-performance file copy tool developed by Electronic Arts. This package provides direct access to EACopy's C++ functionality, offering superior performance for file copying operations.

## Features

- High-performance file copying with direct C++ bindings
- API compatible with Python's `shutil` module
- Support for EACopyService for accelerated network file transfers
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows native, with fallbacks for other platforms)
- Multi-threaded file operations

## Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install py-eacopy
```

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/loonghao/py-eacopy.git
cd py-eacopy

# Install using uv (recommended)
uv sync
uv run maturin develop --release

# Or using pip
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```python
import eacopy

# Copy a file (similar to shutil.copy)
eacopy.copy("source.txt", "destination.txt")

# Copy a file with metadata (similar to shutil.copy2)
eacopy.copy2("source.txt", "destination.txt")

# Copy a directory tree (similar to shutil.copytree)
eacopy.copytree("source_dir", "destination_dir")

# Use EACopyService for accelerated network transfers
eacopy.copy_with_server("source_dir", "destination_dir", "server_address", port=31337)

# Configure global settings
eacopy.config.thread_count = 8  # Use 8 threads for copying
eacopy.config.compression_level = 5  # Use compression level 5 for network transfers
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Rust toolchain** (install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))
- **uv** (recommended, install from [uv docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/loonghao/py-eacopy.git
cd py-eacopy

# Install dependencies using uv (recommended)
uv sync --group all

# Or install specific dependency groups
uv sync --group testing  # For testing
uv sync --group linting  # For code quality
uv sync --group docs     # For documentation
```

### Building from Source

This project uses **maturin** to build Rust extensions:

```bash
# Development build (fast, for testing)
uv run maturin develop

# Release build (optimized)
uv run maturin develop --release

# Build wheel packages
uv run maturin build --release
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests
uv run nox -s test

# Run tests for specific Python version
uv run nox -s test-3.11

# Run linting
uv run nox -s lint

# Fix linting issues automatically
uv run nox -s lint_fix
```

### Documentation

```bash
# Build documentation
uv run nox -s docs

# Serve documentation with live reloading
uv run nox -s docs_serve
```

## Performance Benchmarks

py-eacopy includes comprehensive performance benchmarks and continuous performance monitoring:

### Prerequisites for Benchmarking

Install **hyperfine** (command-line benchmarking tool):

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install hyperfine

# macOS
brew install hyperfine

# Windows (using Chocolatey)
choco install hyperfine

# Or download from: https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine/releases
```

### Local Benchmarking

```bash
# Install benchmark dependencies
uv sync --group testing

# Run all benchmarks
uv run nox -s benchmark

# Run comparison benchmarks vs standard tools
uv run nox -s benchmark_compare

# Generate performance profiles
uv run nox -s profile
```

### Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO) Builds

For maximum performance, use PGO-optimized builds:

```bash
# Build with PGO optimization (takes longer but ~10-15% faster)
uv run nox -s build_pgo

# Regular optimized build
uv run nox -s build

# Verify build works correctly
uv run nox -s verify_build
```

### Continuous Performance Monitoring with CodSpeed

This project uses [CodSpeed](https://codspeed.io/) for continuous performance monitoring:

```bash
# Run CodSpeed benchmarks locally
uv run nox -s codspeed

# Run all CodSpeed benchmarks
uv run nox -s codspeed_all
```

CodSpeed automatically:
- üîç Detects performance regressions in pull requests
- üìä Provides detailed performance analysis and visualizations
- üìà Tracks performance trends over time
- ‚úÖ Integrates seamlessly with our GitHub Actions CI
- üöÄ Uses PGO-optimized builds for accurate performance measurement

### Benchmark Results

Current performance targets:
- **Small files (< 1MB)**: > 100 MB/s
- **Large files (> 10MB)**: > 500 MB/s
- **vs shutil**: 2-5x faster for large files
- **vs robocopy**: Competitive performance (within 20%)
- **PGO builds**: Additional 10-15% performance improvement

See [benchmarks/README.md](benchmarks/README.md) for detailed benchmarking documentation.

## CI/CD Configuration

This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD with the following workflows:

- **Build and Test**: Tests the package on multiple Python versions and operating systems.
- **Release**: Builds and publishes wheels to PyPI when a new release is created.
- **Documentation**: Builds and deploys documentation to GitHub Pages.

The release workflow uses cibuildwheel to build platform-specific wheels with the C++ extensions properly compiled for each platform.

### Release Process

To create a new release:

1. Update the version in `pyproject.toml` and `src/eacopy/__version__.py`
2. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version and changes
3. Commit and push the changes
4. Create a new tag with the version number (e.g., `0.1.0`)
5. Push the tag to GitHub

```bash
# Example release process
git add pyproject.toml src/eacopy/__version__.py CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Release 0.1.0"
git tag 0.1.0
git push && git push --tags
```
